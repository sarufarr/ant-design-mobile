### ImageViewer.Multi

On the basis of `ImageViewer`, the following props have been added:

| Name          | Description                                 | Type                      | Default |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| images        | Url list of image resources                 | `string[]`                | `[]`    |
| defaultIndex  | Which picture would be displayed by default | `number`                  | `0`     |
| onIndexChange | Triggered when the picture is switched      | `(index: number) => void` | -       |

At the same time, the `image` prop is removed.

### Imperative

Compared with the component-based usage above, the command-style is more convenient and more commonly used. In most cases, this method is recommended:

```ts | pure
const handler = ImageViewer.show(props)
const handlerMulti = ImageViewer.Multi.show(props)
```

You can directly enter the image view by calling the `show` method on the `ImageViewer`. The type of the `props` parameter is the same as the above table, but the `visible` prop is not supported. When the viewer is closed, the component instance would be automatically destroyed.

The return value of the `show` method is a component controller, which contains the following props:

| Name  | Description                       | Type         |
| ----- | --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| close | Function to close the ImageViewer | `() => void` |
